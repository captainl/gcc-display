# gcc-display
gamecube display stuff

1. upload the hex file to your arduino using xLoader: https://github.com/xinabox/xLoader
2. plug in your gcc to the adruino adapter while keeping the adapter plugged into your computer through the USB connection
3. run gamecube.exe
4. in your streaming software, add gcbg with some transparency (optional but this makes it look a lot nicer)
5. you can chroma key gamecube.exe with black (0,0,0)

# Troubleshooting

contact me on twitter @captainlpika because I'll be honest literally nobody has used this software except me and when I have a problem I just open the source code and fix it myself :)
